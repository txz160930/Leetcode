Watering Flowers (old version)
Input: plants = [2, 4, 5, 1, 2], capacity = 6
Output: 17
Explanation:
First you water plants[0] and plants[1] (2 steps).
Then you have to go back to refill (2 steps) and water plants[2] and plants[3] (4 steps).
Then again you have to refill (4 steps) and water plants[4] (5 steps).
So 2 + 2 + 4 + 4 + 5 = 17.

class Solution {
	 public int calculateSteps (int[] plants, int capacity) {
	     int remain = capacity;
		 int result = 0;
	     for (int i = 0; i < plants.length; i++) {
		     if (remain >= plants[i]) {
			    remain -= plants[i];
				result++;
			 }
			 else if (remain < plants[i]) {
			    remain = capacity - plants[i];
			    result += 2i + 1;
			 }
		 }
		 
		 return result;
	 }
