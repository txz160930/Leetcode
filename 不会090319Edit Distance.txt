中文English
Given two words word1 and word2, find the minimum number of steps required to convert word1 to word2. (each operation is counted as 1 step.)

You have the following 3 operations permitted on a word:

Insert a character
Delete a character
Replace a character
Example
Example 1:

Input: 
"horse"
"ros"
Output: 3
Explanation: 
horse -> rorse (replace 'h' with 'r')
rorse -> rose (remove 'r')
rose -> ros (remove 'e')
Example 2:

Input: 
"intention"
"execution"
Output: 5
Explanation: 
intention -> inention (remove 't')
inention -> enention (replace 'i' with 'e')
enention -> exention (replace 'n' with 'x')
exention -> exection (replace 'n' with 'c')
exection -> execution (insert 'u')

public class Solution {
    /**
     * @param word1: A string
     * @param word2: A string
     * @return: The minimum number of steps.
     */
    public int minDistance(String word1, String word2) {
        // write your code here
    }
}
